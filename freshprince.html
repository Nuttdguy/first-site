  <h1>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</h1>

  <p>From western Philadelphia I hail
  where in my youth I'd play upon the green
  'til - rue the day! -I found myself assail'd
  by ruffians contemptible and mean.
  Although the spat was trivial and brief,
  it wounded my dear mother deep within;
  and so, to give her conscience sweet relief,
  she sent me forth to live amongst her kin.
  When to my port of call I'd been conveyed,
  I came upon a coachman most unique;
  and yet, I simply took the trip and paid,
  despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique.
  I survey all the land with princely mien
  in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene.</p>
